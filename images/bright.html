			Coldplay - Viva la Vida<br><br>
			
			I used to rule the world<br>
			Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
			Now in the morning I sleep alone<br>
			Sweep the streets I used to own<br>
			I used to roll the dice, feel the fear in my enemy's eyes<br>
			Listen as the crowd would sing<br>
			Now the old King is dead, long live the King<br>
			One minute I held the key<br>
			Next the walls were closed on me<br>
			And I discovered that my castles stand<br>
			Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<br><br>
			
			I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing<br>
			Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
			Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
			My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
			For some reason I can't explain<br>
			Once you go there was never<br>
			Never an honest word<br>
			And that was when I ruled the world<br><br>
			
			It was the wicked and wild wind<br>
			Blew down the doors to let me in<br>
			Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br>
			People couldn't believe what I'd become<br>
			Revolutionaries wait<br>
			For my head on a silver plate<br>
			Just a puppet on a lonely string<br>
			Oh who would ever want to be king?<br><br>
			
			I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing<br>
			Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
			Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
			My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
			For some reason I can't explain<br>
			I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
			Never an honest word<br>
			But that was when I ruled the world<br>
			I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing<br>
			Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
			Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
			My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
			For some reason I can't explain<br>
			I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
			Never an honest word<br>
			But that was when I ruled the world<br>
